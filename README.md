## Supported Applications
Right now this colour scheme is only available for gtk (and gnome-shell), Vivaldi, and Sublime Text but I want to eventually have this colour scheme in every application I regularly use. These include Atom and Steam.

## License
Because the gtk theme and the Vivaldi theme uses graphics from the Arc gtk theme, I've decided to use the same license as Arc, which is the [GPL-3.0](./LICENSE)
